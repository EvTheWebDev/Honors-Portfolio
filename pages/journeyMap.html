    One of the major projects I remember from Honors H200 was the Journey Map.
    As a Freshman with walking into IU Indy, I had a lot of ideas about the path
    that my life would take. The goal of the Journey Map was to take those
    possibilities, and to create different ideas of ways that I could navigate
    through college. Only having <i>just</i> discovered that I enjoyed web
    development, I was unsure of the oppertunities that I would have access to.
    Despite this, these are the ideas that I had had for my IU Indy journey:

  <p>Here's the journey I <i>thought</i> I may go on:</p>

          <p>Obviously, there are multiple paths in that journey map. It would be very hard to get an art minor, Japanese minor, and internship within 4 years. Now, looking back on college, I'm surprised I was able to accomplish as much of my plan as I did.</p>

          <p>Here is the path I ended up taking:</p>

    <p>Looking back on my 2022 journey map, I am suprised at how much I was able to accomplish during four years at IUI. I was able to get my Japanese Studies minor, <i>and</i> apply to a program to teach English in Japan. Freshman year Ev hadn't even thought about that as a possibility!</p> <br><br>
    <p>It <i>is</i> unfortunate that my photography minor from Herron wasn't prioritized, but I am so happy with the other things that I was able to accomplish. I wasn't sure that I'd land an internship, but I am very glad I ended up at Bluum.</p>
