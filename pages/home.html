        <p>Welcome to my honors e-portfolio! I'm Ev Schmitt, a web development major and proud Bepko Scholar! This portfolio will showcase some of my projects, as well as skills and lessons learned during my time in the Honors College at IUI.</p>

<p>To start, take a look at my <a href="#thenAndNow">Then And Now</a> section, where I showcase who I was when I entered IU(PU)I, who I wanted to become, and who I am today.</p>
