<h2>Then And Now: 2022 Evan vs. 2026 Ev</h2>
<p>My journey through college has always been a little... <i>strange</i>. When I first came to IUI, I was planning on being a photography major. Then, during the summer prior to my freshman year, I decided to switch to a degree in Visual Communication Design at the Herron School of Art. <b>THEN</b>, only a week before my first semester started, I was told by my honors advisor that a better program for me was Media Arts and Science (or MAS).</p>
<p>I wasn't sure <i>exactly</i> what MAS was, but I decided to dive in headfirst anyway. Now, instead of being at the Herron School of Art, I was at the Luddy School of Informatics. I had no idea at the time, but that switch would drastically change my entire trajectory in life.</p>
<br>
<p>As a part of Honors H200, we write an "I Am" statement, as well as an "I Want to Become" statement. Here is what I had to say in 2022:</p>

<div class="then">
    <h3>I Am (2022)</h3>
<p><i>I am a kind, hardworking, and open-minded member of IUPUI's Bepko scholars. Some of my happiest moments in life come from volunteer work, either through organizations on campus or in the Indianapolis area like the Indiana House Rabbit Society. I love helping others, whether or not they are friends or strangers. My family and friends encourage and inspire me to constantly improve, while staying true to my values.</i></p>

<h3>I Want to Become (2022)</h3>
<p><i>I want to become a more involved member of on campus societies at IUPUI. While I spend time in organizations now, I think that becoming a leader in one of these organizations would be a great way to better my leadership skills. Additionally, I want to utilize my honors projects for more than I currently have been. Instead of focusing on them as projects like I did for my first semester at IUPUI, I am going to try thinking more broadly. For example, this semester’s project is also a massive portfolio piece, and a great addition to a charity I love and am happy to support. In the future, I hope to make more projects that will help me past the honors contract. I imagine gaining many different projects and making a great web development portfolio for internships and careers later in life.<br><br>

I would also like to become more social throughout college. While I have friends, I avoid going to large meetings for clubs and organizations. I hope that, over the next year or so, I can overcome this fear and involve myself more in many on campus clubs. I feel like I spent the majority of this year finding my footing in college and discovering what specialization within my major I want to pursue, and I think that next year will give me the opportunity to be more social. I think that knowing my major will allow me to have many more peers that share multiple classes with me, allowing me to make more social connections with people.</i></p>

<div class="now">
    <p>Now, here's what I have to say as I stare down the barrel of adulthood:</p>

<h3>I Am (2026)</h3>
<p>Funnily enough, I still agree with everything I said during my freshman year. I still consider myself hardworking, kind, and constantly encouraged by my family. However, I have so much more that I am able to say now. I am <i>also</i> an RA, and a Peer Advisor in my school. Freshman me would have <b>never</b> considered being an RA, but it is one of the defining aspects of who I am as a college student. I remember the struggle to find people that I resonated with my freshman year, and I carried that struggle throughout the majority of my time in school. However, the friends I have made as an RA are some of my favorite people, and I can confidently say that I was finally able to "be more social", just like 18-year-old me was hoping for.</p>

<h3>I Want to Become (2026):</h3>
<p>Something freshman year Ev would have <i>NEVER</i> considered was a career in education. However, I would love to become a teacher someday. Whether it's by finishing my Master of Arts for Teachers or by serving as a Language Teacher in Japan through the JET program, a focus on education is my next step as I leave undergrad. Freshman year Ev had hoped to make video games, but I learned just how important websites and apps are as well. I have done a lot of work with a tech startup aimed at children in inpatient care, and it has been the most rewarding and exciting project I've ever been a part of. I hope that one day this project could lead to a career.</p><br>
<p>In terms of personal growth, I still want to become a more social person. While I am leaps and bounds more extroverted than I was when I entered college, I've only recently started to actually feel <i>comfortable</i> speaking in large crowds. Because of my time as an RA, I've been able to present at national conferences! The app I created has allowed me the ability to network with professionals and pitch an idea effectively. However, these skills are just starting to bloom. I want to continue to build upon these skills and break out of my shell.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Looking back at my statements from 2022, I am proud of how far I've come. I was able to become more social, take on campus leadership roles, and create some projects that I am truly proud of. However, I still have many things I'd like to do and skills I'll be working to improve. Even though my time in undergrad is running short, I think there's plenty more learning for me to do.</p>
