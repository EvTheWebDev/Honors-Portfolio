<h2>Then And Now: 2022 Evan vs. 2026 Ev</h2>
<p>My jouney through college has always been a little... <i>strange</i>. When I first came to IUI, I was planning on being a photography major. Then, during the summer prior to my Freshman year, I decided to switch to a degree in Visual Communication Design at the Herron School of Art. <b>THEN</b>, only a week before my first semester started, I was told by my honors advisor that a better program for me was Media Arts and Science (MAS).</p>
<p>I wasn't sure <i>exactly</i> what MAS was, but I decided to dive in headfirst anyway. Now, instead of being at the Herron school of art, I was at the Luddy school of informatics. I had no idea at the time, but that switch would drasticaly change my entire trejectory in life.</p>
<p>As a part of Honors H200, we write an "I Am" statement, as well as a "I Want to Become" statement. Here is what I had to say in 2022:</p>

<h3>I Am</h3>
<p>I am a kind, hardworking, and open-minded member of IUPUI's Bepko scholars. Some of my happiest moments in life come from volunteer work, either through organizations on campus or in the Indianapolis area like the Indiana House Rabbit Society. I love helping others, whether or not they are friends or strangers. My family and friends encourage and inspire me to constantly improve, while staying true to my values.</p>

<h3>I Want to Become</h3>
<p>I want to become a more involved member of on campus societies at IUPUI. While I spend time in organizations now, I think that becoming a leader in one of these organizations would be a great way to better my leadership skills. Additionally, I want to utilize my honors projects for more than I currently have been. Instead of focusing on them as projects like I did for my first semester at IUPUI, I am going to try thinking more broadly. For example, this semester’s project is also a massive portfolio piece, and a great addition to a charity I love and am happy to support. In the future, I hope to make more projects that will help me past the honors contract. I imagine gaining many different projects and making a great web development portfolio for internships and careers later in life. </p>

I would also like to become more social throughout college. While I have friends, I avoid going to large meetings for clubs and organizations. I hope that, over the next year or so, I can overcome this fear and involve myself more in many on campus clubs. I feel like I spent the majority of this year finding my footing in college and discovering what specialization within my major I want to pursue, and I think that next year will give me the opportunity to be more social. I think that knowing my major will allow me to have many more peers that share multiple classes with me, allowing me to make more social connections with people.</p>
